void Network_InitTxRx(void)
{
    // REG_APE_PERFECT_MATCH1_{HIGH,LOW}. For non-broadcast/multicast traffic, the hardware uses this register to match MACs and pass traffic to the APE.
    // The first two bytes of a MAC are put in the HIGH register, and the remaining four bytes in the LOW.
    // Note that this is a device (PCI) register, not an APE register. Set it to the BMC MAC.

    // REG_APE__BMC_NC_RX_SRC_MAC_MATCHN_{HIGH,LOW}.
    // This appears to relate to the RMU, not network RX, but its exact purpose is unknown.
    // Set it to the BMC MAC. Unlike the "perfect match" register above, it takes a different format:
    // for an example MAC AABB.CCDD.EEFF, set HIGH=0xAABBCCDD, LOW=0xEEFF0000.
    // *** NOTE: set to 0 in rmu.c ***

    // Ensure REG_EMAC_MODE__ENABLE_APE_{TX,RX}_PATH are set.
    // *** NOTE: Both bits are set in rmu.c ***/
